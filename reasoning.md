Got it. I’ll collect empirical data on gas usage and fee dynamics from Ethereum mainnet, Avalanche (especially the C-Chain), and Base to assess how often blocks are full, how volatile the fees are, how frequently blocks hit target utilization, and whether supply-demand clears effectively under their EIP-1559-style models.

I’ll use these insights to recommend optimal fee parameters for your Avalanche Subnet design.

# Gas Fee Mechanisms on Ethereum, Avalanche C-Chain, and Base: Empirical Analysis and Recommendations

## Introduction  
EIP-1559 introduced a **dynamic “base fee” mechanism** to make transaction fees more predictable and to help the network self-regulate congestion ([Transaction Fees on a Honeymoon: Ethereum&#x0027;s EIP-1559 One Month Later](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/180741021/Transaction_Fees_on_a_Honeymoon_Ethereums_EIP_1559_One_Month_Later.pdf#:~:text=,which)). Under this model, each block has a **target gas utilization (usually 50% of the max block gas)**, and the base fee rises or falls depending on whether the previous block was above or below this target ([Transaction Fees on a Honeymoon: Ethereum&#x0027;s EIP-1559 One Month Later](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/180741021/Transaction_Fees_on_a_Honeymoon_Ethereums_EIP_1559_One_Month_Later.pdf#:~:text=,which)). Several blockchain networks – including **Ethereum Mainnet**, **Avalanche’s C-Chain**, and **Coinbase’s Base (Ethereum L2)** – have implemented EIP-1559-style fee markets (with variations) to balance throughput and fee stability. In this assessment, we compare empirical data from these networks on block utilization, base fee volatility, and congestion management, and derive insights to design a stable gas fee mechanism for a **USDC-focused Avalanche Subnet (PoA L1)**.

We will examine: **(1)** how often blocks are full or under-utilized on each chain, **(2)** how frequently blocks sit near the target gas usage, **(3)** the volatility of base fees (how rapidly they change), **(4)** whether the fee market clears demand effectively (or if backlogs persist), and **(5)** any special smoothing or fee cap mechanisms in use. Finally, we provide **actionable recommendations** – specific parameter choices for base fee adjustment rate, minimum fee, gas targets, etc. – for the USDC subnet’s gas fee mechanism, with an emphasis on **fee stability** and predictable costs.

## Ethereum Mainnet (EIP-1559 Fee Market)  

**Block Utilization and Fullness:** Ethereum’s London upgrade (Aug 2021) set the block gas target to 50% of the **max block gas limit**, meaning on average blocks should be half-full ([Transaction Fees on a Honeymoon: Ethereum&#x0027;s EIP-1559 One Month Later](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/180741021/Transaction_Fees_on_a_Honeymoon_Ethereums_EIP_1559_One_Month_Later.pdf#:~:text=,which)). In practice, this is roughly what has been observed. Post EIP-1559, block gas usage varies between empty and the maximum (~30 million gas), but gravitates around the 15 million gas target on average ([Empirical Analysis of EIP-1559: Transaction Fees, Waiting Times, and Consensus Security](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05574#:~:text=block%20gas%20used%20remains%20around,The%20base%20fee)). Empirical data in late 2021 showed that approximately **20% of Ethereum blocks reach full capacity** (consume the entire 30M gas, i.e. 2× target) after EIP-1559 ([Empirical Analysis of EIP-1559: Transaction Fees, Waiting Times, and Consensus Security](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05574#:~:text=%28b%29%20Approximately%2020,Distribution%20of%20Block%20Gas%20Used)). The remaining ~80% of blocks are **under the max size**, often near the target usage or lower. In normal network conditions (moderate demand), many blocks use about the target gas (half-full), with some slack capacity. Only during surges do a significant fraction of blocks become completely full. This behavior contrasts with the pre-EIP-1559 era when blocks were almost **always full to the limit** – now the protocol intentionally allows blocks to be half-empty on average to absorb variations in demand ([Transaction Fees on a Honeymoon: Ethereum&#x0027;s EIP-1559 One Month Later](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/180741021/Transaction_Fees_on_a_Honeymoon_Ethereums_EIP_1559_One_Month_Later.pdf#:~:text=,which)).

**Base Fee Dynamics and Volatility:** Ethereum’s base fee is algorithmically adjusted **each block** by at most **±12.5%** (the protocol’s “learning rate”) depending on gas used relative to the target ([Transaction Fees on a Honeymoon: Ethereum&#x0027;s EIP-1559 One Month Later](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/180741021/Transaction_Fees_on_a_Honeymoon_Ethereums_EIP_1559_One_Month_Later.pdf#:~:text=size%20%28half,which)) ([Analysis of EIP-1559 - Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/analysis-of-eip-1559/#:~:text=State%20of%20extended%20congestion%3A%20It,initial%20BASEFEE%20%3D%201%20Gwei)). If a block is above the 15M gas target, the base fee increases (up to +12.5% if the block is full 30M); if below target, it decreases (up to –12.5% if the block is empty) ([Fueling Gas Spells on Dune part 1](https://dune.com/blog/fueling-gas-spells-1#:~:text=The%20base%20fee%20is%20automatically,space%20for%20a%20long%20time)). Under stable demand, this yields gradual fee changes and **predictable gas prices**. However, in periods of rapidly changing demand, Ethereum does experience **short-term fee volatility**. Researchers observed “intense, chaotic oscillations in block sizes” and **“slow adjustments during periods of demand bursts”** (e.g. NFT mints) in the first month of EIP-1559 ([Transaction Fees on a Honeymoon: Ethereum&#x0027;s EIP-1559 One Month Later](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/180741021/Transaction_Fees_on_a_Honeymoon_Ethereums_EIP_1559_One_Month_Later.pdf#:~:text=evaluate%20the%20impact%20of%20EIP,alternative%20base%20fee%20adjustment%20rule)). This means during a sudden congestion event, you might see a sequence of blocks all full (base fee ratcheting up each time), followed by a series of under-filled blocks as the high fees then overshoot and suppress demand ([Analysis of EIP-1559 - Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/analysis-of-eip-1559/#:~:text=Image)). For example, if blocks stay at double capacity for many in a row, the base fee can grow exponentially fast – **after 100 full blocks in a row, the base fee would be ~**`(1.125)^100 ≈ 339x`** higher** ([Analysis of EIP-1559 - Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/analysis-of-eip-1559/#:~:text=Consider%20a%20BASEFEE%20of%201,the%20power%20of%20exponential%20growth)), pricing out most transactions. Once demand subsides, it can take numerous empty or small blocks for the base fee to come back down ([Analysis of EIP-1559 - Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/analysis-of-eip-1559/#:~:text=Imagine%20there%20have%20been%20100,5m%20gas%2C%20and%20so%20on)). In summary, **on average Ethereum’s base fee is stable** (achieving the goal of ~50% utilization), but **on short timescales** it can swing significantly: it **rises sharply** during congestion and **falls once the surge passes**, causing a sawtooth pattern of full blocks then low-utilization blocks ([Analysis of EIP-1559 - Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/analysis-of-eip-1559/#:~:text=Image)). These oscillations are “nothing to worry about” from a protocol standpoint (they clear the backlog), but they do imply **fee volatility** in the minutes surrounding a traffic spike ([Empirical Analysis of EIP-1559: Transaction Fees, Waiting Times, and Consensus Security](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05574#:~:text=M%20to%2030%20M,before%20the%20Lon%02don%20hard%20fork)).

**Congestion Clearing and Backlogs:** The EIP-1559 mechanism is designed so that **supply and demand clear** fairly quickly via price. When usage is persistently high, the base fee keeps increasing until fewer users are willing to pay, thereby **pushing demand down** to fit in the available block space ([Analysis of EIP-1559 - Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/analysis-of-eip-1559/#:~:text=State%20of%20occasional%20congestion%3A%20As,BASEFEE%20will%20start%20to%20decline)). In Ethereum’s post-1559 fee market, **persistent backlogs are generally avoided** except during extreme surges. Users can always eventually get included by paying the going base fee (plus a small priority tip). If a user’s transaction has too low of a max fee, it will remain pending while base fee rises – effectively a backlog for those underpriced tx – but **the protocol ensures new supply (block space) is made available each block (up to 2× normal size)** and the price adjusts upward to clear out the excess demand ([Analysis of EIP-1559 - Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/analysis-of-eip-1559/#:~:text=State%20of%20occasional%20congestion%3A%20As,BASEFEE%20will%20start%20to%20decline)). For example, during a notorious NFT drop in 2022, base fees spiked into hundreds of gwei, but the spike lasted only hours before prices normalized, indicating the backlog was mined out as fees reached equilibrium. **In steady state**, Ethereum’s mempool does not grow without bound; any transient pile-up of transactions is resolved by the base fee increases. Only if demand kept exceeding capacity *even at extremely high fees* would a sustained backlog occur – in practice, demand softens as fees climb. Thus, **demand and supply equilibrate** with price: users effectively “queue” by bidding a higher fee, not by waiting in a long line. (Notably, if many users all set a **fee cap** below the clearing price, those transactions can remain stuck pending – but that’s a user configuration issue. The network as a whole continues operating at capacity with those who do pay the market-clearing fee.)

**Fee Floor or Caps:** Ethereum’s implementation does **not enforce an explicit minimum or maximum base fee** in protocol – the fee can theoretically drop to near-zero in periods of very low usage, and can rise without bound (until users simply stop submitting pricey transactions). In quiet times, we have indeed seen base fees drop to just a few gwei (and if it were ever mostly idle, base fee would keep decaying exponentially towards 0). In practice there’s usually some baseline demand keeping it at a few gwei. On the upside, there’s similarly no fixed cap on Ethereum’s base fee beyond the per-block 12.5% increment limit. **Each block’s size is capped**, so there is a *de facto* rate at which fees can climb – about a 12.5% compound growth per block if blocks keep maxing out ([Analysis of EIP-1559 - Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/analysis-of-eip-1559/#:~:text=State%20of%20extended%20congestion%3A%20It,initial%20BASEFEE%20%3D%201%20Gwei)). This ensures some smoothing (it takes a number of blocks for fees to become extremely high). But Ethereum doesn’t impose a hard ceiling like “stop at 1000 gwei”; it relies on the market to decide that. There is also **no smoothing beyond the single-block horizon** – the base fee reacts **block by block**. This simplicity keeps the mechanism responsive but means **short-term fee swings are possible** as described. 

In summary, **Ethereum’s EIP-1559 fee market** generally achieves **half-full blocks on average** (only ~20% of blocks hit 100% fullness) ([Empirical Analysis of EIP-1559: Transaction Fees, Waiting Times, and Consensus Security](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05574#:~:text=%28b%29%20Approximately%2020,Distribution%20of%20Block%20Gas%20Used)), and it **adapts fees** to match demand, preventing long-lasting congestion. Base fees are usually predictable but can be **volatile during usage spikes**, where we observe rapid fee run-ups and subsequent oscillation. No extra fee smoothing or clamps exist aside from the intrinsic 12.5% step limit, making Ethereum’s fee mechanism a **pure market-driven system** with algorithmic price adjustment.

## Avalanche C-Chain (Dynamic “Moderato” Fee Algorithm)  

**Fee Mechanism Overview:** Avalanche’s C-Chain implemented EIP-1559-style *dynamic fees* in Aug 2021 with the **Apricot Phase 3 (“AP3”)** upgrade. The algorithm, code-named **“Moderato,”** adjusts the minimum gas price (base fee) based on recent network utilization ([Apricot Phase Three: C-Chain Dynamic Fees | by Patrick O'Grady | Avalanche | Medium](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/apricot-phase-three-c-chain-dynamic-fees-432d32d67b60#:~:text=Moderato%3A%20Dynamic%20Fees%20Overview)). The key difference is that Avalanche uses a **time-based rolling window** rather than single-block updates, due to its high-frequency, asynchronous block production. In Moderato, the base fee is computed as a function of the **gas used in the last N seconds (N=10s window)** compared to a target gas usage for that window ([Apricot Phase Three: C-Chain Dynamic Fees | by Patrick O'Grady | Avalanche | Medium](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/apricot-phase-three-c-chain-dynamic-fees-432d32d67b60#:~:text=Because%20block%20production%20is%20asynchronous,as%20the%20block%20content%20itself)) ([Apricot Phase Three: C-Chain Dynamic Fees | by Patrick O'Grady | Avalanche | Medium](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/apricot-phase-three-c-chain-dynamic-fees-432d32d67b60#:~:text=%2A%20Time,of%20the%20new%20dynamic%20fee)). If the cumulative gas used in the recent 10s exceeds the target (network overutilized), the base fee rises; if it’s below target (underutilized), the base fee falls ([Apricot Phase Three: C-Chain Dynamic Fees | by Patrick O'Grady | Avalanche | Medium](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/apricot-phase-three-c-chain-dynamic-fees-432d32d67b60#:~:text=AP3%20introduces%20dynamic%20fees%20on,at%20a%20specific%20fee%20rate)) ([Apricot Phase Three: C-Chain Dynamic Fees | by Patrick O'Grady | Avalanche | Medium](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/apricot-phase-three-c-chain-dynamic-fees-432d32d67b60#:~:text=window%20of%20activity%2C%20where%20block,as%20the%20block%20content%20itself)). Essentially, Avalanche measures **gas usage per 10-second interval** (including a “synthetic” overhead for each block to account for block frequency) and adjusts fees up or down to push usage toward a target threshold ([Apricot Phase Three: C-Chain Dynamic Fees | by Patrick O'Grady | Avalanche | Medium](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/apricot-phase-three-c-chain-dynamic-fees-432d32d67b60#:~:text=Because%20block%20production%20is%20asynchronous,as%20the%20block%20content%20itself)) ([Apricot Phase Three: C-Chain Dynamic Fees | by Patrick O'Grady | Avalanche | Medium](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/apricot-phase-three-c-chain-dynamic-fees-432d32d67b60#:~:text=window%20of%20activity%2C%20where%20block,as%20the%20block%20content%20itself)). This windowed approach smooths out per-block variance and prevents gaming the fee by simply producing many tiny blocks or timing bursts between blocks ([Apricot Phase Three: C-Chain Dynamic Fees | by Patrick O'Grady | Avalanche | Medium](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/apricot-phase-three-c-chain-dynamic-fees-432d32d67b60#:~:text=Because%20block%20production%20is%20asynchronous,as%20the%20block%20content%20itself)). It’s analogous to Ethereum’s mechanism but **averaged over multiple blocks** – achieving a similar effect of targeting a certain utilization level over time.

**Target Utilization and Block Fullness:** A notable aspect of Avalanche’s initial parameter choices was a **conservative gas target**. In AP3, the C-Chain was configured with a **target of 10 million gas per 10 seconds** ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=In%20December%2C%20Apricot%20Phase%205,state%20growth%20problems%20as%20Ethereum)). For context, Avalanche blocks are produced on a ~1–2s cadence (variable), and the *maximum* gas per 10s was much higher. In fact, 10M/10s was only **25% of the theoretical throughput** the network could handle ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=Ava%20Labs%20quickly%20responded%20to,as%20gas%20consumption%20has%20increased)). (By comparison, Ethereum’s target is 50% of max.) This low target was intended to limit state growth and prevent spam, but it turned out to be **too restrictive** in practice ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=set%20the%20target%20gas%20to,state%20growth%20problems%20as%20Ethereum)) ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=Ava%20Labs%20quickly%20responded%20to,as%20gas%20consumption%20has%20increased)). As Avalanche usage surged in late 2021 (during the DeFi “Rush” and NFT activity), the 25%-utilization target meant the base fee started ramping up even when blocks were only one-quarter full on average ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=Ava%20Labs%20quickly%20responded%20to,as%20gas%20consumption%20has%20increased)). Users saw fees spike sharply (e.g. **swaps costing $10-$20** in AVAX fees) and the chain was perceived as congested despite plenty of unused block space ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=set%20the%20target%20gas%20to,state%20growth%20problems%20as%20Ethereum)) ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=representing%20block%20utilization%20of%2025,as%20gas%20consumption%20has%20increased)). To address this, **Apricot Phase 5 (Dec 2021)** raised the gas target to **15 million per 10s** – a 50% increase, bringing target utilization to ~37.5% of max ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=Ava%20Labs%20quickly%20responded%20to,as%20gas%20consumption%20has%20increased)). This immediately increased throughput and eased fees: after AP5, Avalanche’s daily gas usage rose and average fees dropped, with much smoother volatility ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=representing%20block%20utilization%20of%2025,as%20gas%20consumption%20has%20increased)). In effect, Avalanche moved closer to Ethereum’s 50% target (though still a bit more conservative). With the higher target, blocks could carry more transactions before triggering fee hikes. **Empirically, Avalanche’s blocks are often not full** except during demand peaks. In normal periods (especially in 2022–2023), the C-Chain has had relatively low usage, and blocks frequently run below the target gas levels. **Many blocks are partly empty, and the base fee sits at its minimum value** in those times. For example, Avalanche developers noted that the previous 25 nAVAX minimum fee was often hit, meaning the network was under capacity and could have cheaper fees without harm ([ACP-125: Reduce C-Chain minimum base fee from 25 nAVAX to 1 nAVAX · avalanche-foundation ACPs · Discussion #127 · GitHub](https://github.com/avalanche-foundation/ACPs/discussions/127#:~:text=1,transactions%2C%20benefiting%20the%20entire%20ecosystem)). After increasing capacity and later lowering the fee floor, Avalanche blocks now rarely fill up unless there’s an unusual spike. During extreme bursts (e.g. a popular mint or airdrop), blocks or the 10s window can reach 100% utilization (i.e. the chain processing at max throughput); those are the moments when base fee will climb to throttle demand. But outside of those, Avalanche usually operates *below* its limits – a deliberate design choice to keep fees stable.

**Base Fee Volatility and Smoothing:** Avalanche’s fee algorithm yields **smoother fee dynamics** compared to Ethereum’s block-by-block swings. By averaging usage over 10-second windows, sudden one-block spikes have a diluted effect. The base fee cannot jump as abruptly from a single block’s activity; it responds to the aggregate demand over multiple blocks. This, combined with Avalanche’s generally **ample headroom** (post-AP5), has resulted in **lower volatility in base fees**. After the AP5 update, observers noted that gas price **volatility was meaningfully smoothed and fees went down even as gas consumption increased** ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=representing%20block%20utilization%20of%2025,as%20gas%20consumption%20has%20increased)). In other words, the network could handle more transactions with only a modest increase in fees. Avalanche’s base fee still follows demand – if usage stays above target for extended periods, the fee will steadily increase – but the **oscillations are less “chaotic”** than Ethereum’s and occur over longer timescales. For instance, instead of a dramatic spike within minutes, Avalanche might see a more gradual fee rise over tens of seconds or minutes if activity stays high. Once demand ebbs, the fee similarly glides down. This behavior was evident in late 2021: pre-AP5, fees oscillated wildly as the low target caused frequent overshoots; post-AP5, fees stabilized considerably ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=set%20the%20target%20gas%20to,state%20growth%20problems%20as%20Ethereum)) ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=Ava%20Labs%20quickly%20responded%20to,as%20gas%20consumption%20has%20increased)). It’s worth noting Avalanche did (and to some extent still does) impose **explicit bounds** on the base fee. Initially, Moderato capped the fee between **75 nAVAX and 225 nAVAX** (where 1 AVAX = 1e9 nAVAX) ([Apricot Phase Three: C-Chain Dynamic Fees | by Patrick O'Grady | Avalanche | Medium](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/apricot-phase-three-c-chain-dynamic-fees-432d32d67b60#:~:text=minimum%20gas%20price%20decreases,as%20has%20been)). That meant no matter how low demand got, base fee wouldn’t drop below 75 nAVAX (and no matter how high demand, it wouldn’t exceed 225 nAVAX) during that phase. This range corresponded to 75–225 gwei, with 225 gwei being the old fixed gas price. This cap was set to ensure a smooth transition and to prevent extremely high fees. In practice, **225 nAVAX (225 gwei) became the safety brake** – during the 2021 rush, base fee hit the upper cap at times, and could not rise further ([Apricot Phase Three: C-Chain Dynamic Fees | by Patrick O'Grady | Avalanche | Medium](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/apricot-phase-three-c-chain-dynamic-fees-432d32d67b60#:~:text=minimum%20gas%20price%20decreases,as%20has%20been)). That protected users from unlimited fee spikes, but it also meant if demand remained beyond what 225 gwei pricing could handle, excess transactions had to queue. In subsequent upgrades, Avalanche **lowered the minimum fee dramatically** (from 25 nAVAX to **1 nAVAX** in the Dec 2024 *Etna* upgrade) ([Etna: Enhancing the Sovereignty of Avalanche L1 Networks | Avalanche Blog](https://www.avax.network/blog/etna-enhancing-the-sovereignty-of-avalanche-l1-networks#:~:text=This%20upgrade%20activates%20ACP,during%20periods%20of%20low%20activity)), while keeping the upper bound reasonable (the 225 gwei cap was still in effect at least until then). Reducing the min base fee by 96% made Avalanche **much cheaper in periods of low activity** ([Etna: Enhancing the Sovereignty of Avalanche L1 Networks | Avalanche Blog](https://www.avax.network/blog/etna-enhancing-the-sovereignty-of-avalanche-l1-networks#:~:text=This%20upgrade%20activates%20ACP,during%20periods%20of%20low%20activity)) – effectively almost free (1 nAVAX is ~$0.00000004 at the time of upgrade) – without sacrificing the dynamic adjustment at high load. The rationale was that the previous floor of 25 nAVAX was **higher than market demand and was artificially constraining usage** ([ACP-125: Reduce C-Chain minimum base fee from 25 nAVAX to 1 nAVAX · avalanche-foundation ACPs · Discussion #127 · GitHub](https://github.com/avalanche-foundation/ACPs/discussions/127#:~:text=1,transactions%2C%20benefiting%20the%20entire%20ecosystem)). After lowering it, when the network is quiet the base fee stays at 1 nAVAX, and we see **very low, stable fees** for users. Only when traffic picks up does the fee climb off that floor. Overall, Avalanche’s design choices (time-based averaging, a moderate utilization target, and fee bounds) lead to a **fee profile that is more stable** than Ethereum’s on short timescales. Spikes are tempered, and there’s a guaranteed low fee during idle times (the min fee) as well as a governor on extreme highs (the max fee cap).

**Demand vs. Supply (Clearing Congestion):** Avalanche’s approach to congestion is twofold: **dynamically raise fees** *and* **potentially increase capacity**. The dynamic fee mechanism works similarly to Ethereum’s in principle – if usage exceeds the target, fees increase to discourage some transactions. During congested periods (e.g. the DeFi rush), the base fee did climb steeply (hitting the cap) which priced out low-value transactions. However, Avalanche’s philosophy has been to **avoid prolonged congestion by enlarging throughput where possible**. The jump from 10M to 15M gas target in AP5 was essentially an increase in supply to meet demand ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=Ava%20Labs%20quickly%20responded%20to,as%20gas%20consumption%20has%20increased)). This reduced the need for extremely high fees to clear the market. Post-AP5, even as Avalanche usage grew, the network managed to process more transactions at lower fees, indicating the backlog was alleviated by extra capacity ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=representing%20block%20utilization%20of%2025,as%20gas%20consumption%20has%20increased)). In steady state, Avalanche burns all transaction fees (base + tip) rather than giving them to validators ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=Transaction%20fees%20on%20the%20C,the%20miners)). This means validators have no direct incentive to favor higher fees; the fee mechanism’s sole purpose is to regulate usage and prevent spam. When the base fee hit its upper cap of 225 nAVAX and demand still exceeded supply, the C-Chain would start accumulating a **backlog** (since it couldn’t raise fees further to deter transactions). Users at that point had no option to outbid via base fee (capped), though they could still add tip, which Avalanche also burns but *does* use to prioritize transactions ([Transaction Fees | Avalanche Builder Hub](https://build.avax.network/docs/api-reference/guides/txn-fees#:~:text=The%20fee%20cap%20specifies%20the,and%20the%20gas%20tip%20cap)) ([Transaction Fees | Avalanche Builder Hub](https://build.avax.network/docs/api-reference/guides/txn-fees#:~:text=Transactions%20are%20ordered%20by%20the,oldest%20first)). In essence, at cap, the fee market falls back to first-price auction on priority fee – similar to Ethereum’s behavior when blocks are full and everyone is paying at least base fee ([Analysis of EIP-1559 - Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/analysis-of-eip-1559/#:~:text=As%20blocks%20approach%20the%20cap,to%20pay%20BASEFEE%20or%20not)). Fortunately, such scenarios have been relatively rare on Avalanche after the adjustments. More often, the base fee floats below the cap and finds an equilibrium. **Persistent backlogs on Avalanche are uncommon**; the combination of fee increases and timely network upgrades has kept the chain from grinding under unmet demand. If anything, Avalanche has leaned toward **over-provisioning** capacity (with subnets etc.) to ensure low fees. The introduction of a 1 nAVAX minimum fee in 2024 shows confidence that the dynamic algorithm can handle fluctuations at even lower fee levels without instability ([ACP-125: Reduce C-Chain minimum base fee from 25 nAVAX to 1 nAVAX · avalanche-foundation ACPs · Discussion #127 · GitHub](https://github.com/avalanche-foundation/ACPs/discussions/127#:~:text=transactions%2C%20benefiting%20the%20entire%20ecosystem,costs%20can%20stimulate%20network%20activity)). So, Avalanche’s fee market generally *clears* demand by raising price, but with a philosophy of quickly **tuning parameters** if the market persistently indicates the need (e.g., if fees are high for extended periods, they’d likely scale up throughput or lower the fee constants). The result is that Avalanche today usually operates with **minimal fees and no backlog** except during short-lived spikes; any sustained increase in usage tends to be met with protocol changes to accommodate more throughput.

**Fee Smoothing and Enforcement:** To summarize Avalanche’s unique features: it **smooths fees over time** (10-second windows), enforces a **fee floor** (now extremely low at 1 nAVAX) ([Etna: Enhancing the Sovereignty of Avalanche L1 Networks | Avalanche Blog](https://www.avax.network/blog/etna-enhancing-the-sovereignty-of-avalanche-l1-networks#:~:text=This%20upgrade%20activates%20ACP,during%20periods%20of%20low%20activity)), and historically enforced a **fee ceiling** (225 nAVAX) ([Apricot Phase Three: C-Chain Dynamic Fees | by Patrick O'Grady | Avalanche | Medium](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/apricot-phase-three-c-chain-dynamic-fees-432d32d67b60#:~:text=minimum%20gas%20price%20decreases,as%20has%20been)). Additionally, **100% of fees are burned** on C-Chain (even the “tip”) ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=Transaction%20fees%20on%20the%20C,the%20miners)) – which is different from Ethereum where miners/validators collect the tips. Burning the tip means Avalanche validators are neutral to transaction ordering; this arguably improves fairness and aligns the fee mechanism purely with network health (and has a slight deflationary effect on AVAX). Avalanche’s priority fee is purely to prioritize transactions in the mempool ordering, not to enrich block producers ([Transaction Fees | Avalanche Builder Hub](https://build.avax.network/docs/api-reference/guides/txn-fees#:~:text=The%20fee%20cap%20specifies%20the,and%20the%20gas%20tip%20cap)). These design decisions aim to **maximize fee stability** and predictability: users know there’s a floor below which fees won’t drop (so extremely low-value spam is discouraged), and there’s some notion of an upper reasonable bound so they won’t face infinite fees. Empirical evidence (fee oscillation reduction after AP5, increased usage after lowering min fee) shows these measures have worked to **make Avalanche’s fee market efficient and user-friendly** ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=Ava%20Labs%20quickly%20responded%20to,as%20gas%20consumption%20has%20increased)) ([ACP-125: Reduce C-Chain minimum base fee from 25 nAVAX to 1 nAVAX · avalanche-foundation ACPs · Discussion #127 · GitHub](https://github.com/avalanche-foundation/ACPs/discussions/127#:~:text=1,transactions%2C%20benefiting%20the%20entire%20ecosystem)).  

## Base (Coinbase’s L2 on Ethereum)  

**Fee Mechanism and L2 Specifics:** **Base** is an EVM-compatible Layer-2 network built on the Optimism OP Stack. It inherits Ethereum’s EIP-1559 style fee mechanism for **L2 execution** transactions ([Base 101: How Gas Works On Base](https://www.blocknative.com/blog/base-101-how-gas-works-on-base-1#:~:text=The%20primary%20intention%20of%20EIP,into%20its%20network%20fee%20structure)). Every transaction on Base actually involves two fee components: an **L2 gas fee** (paid in the L2’s native token, which on Base is ETH bridged to L2) and an **L1 data fee** for posting the transaction data back to Ethereum ([Base 101: How Gas Works On Base](https://www.blocknative.com/blog/base-101-how-gas-works-on-base-1#:~:text=Every%20transaction%20on%20Base%20has,higher%20than%20L2%20execution%20fee)). Focusing on the L2 side, Base uses the familiar base fee + priority fee model. Coinbase **adopted EIP-1559 in Base’s network fee structure** from the get-go ([Base 101: How Gas Works On Base](https://www.blocknative.com/blog/base-101-how-gas-works-on-base-1#:~:text=The%20primary%20intention%20of%20EIP,into%20its%20network%20fee%20structure)) – meaning Base computes a base fee each block (or each “epoch” of the L2) that rises and falls with L2 block utilization, just like Ethereum. Users specify `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` when sending transactions on Base, and the protocol burns the base fee portion (likely by not crediting it back to anyone, since there’s no mining on L2) and uses the priority fee to reward the sequencer or order transactions. In essence, from a user perspective, **Base’s transaction fee mechanism feels like Ethereum’s**, with the difference that fees are much lower because Base blocks have more capacity and L2 execution is cheaper. (The separate **L1 security fee** is typically larger than the L2 fee and depends on Ethereum’s gas price for call data ([Base 101: How Gas Works On Base](https://www.blocknative.com/blog/base-101-how-gas-works-on-base-1#:~:text=Every%20transaction%20on%20Base%20has,higher%20than%20L2%20execution%20fee)), but that is outside the EIP-1559 mechanism proper; Base provides estimation tools for it, and the user pays it as part of the transaction costs.)

**Block Utilization on Base:** Base is a new network (Mainnet launched 2023) and has been gradually **scaling up its throughput**. The Base team has indicated a roadmap of incrementally raising the gas limits to eventually achieve on the order of **1 gigagas per second** of throughput ([Base Gas Target & Throughput](https://dune.com/lifewillbeokay/base-gas-target-and-throughput#:~:text=Base%20Gas%20Target%20%26%20Throughput,to%20reach%201%20Ggas%2Fs%20throughput)), far above current L1 capacity. In its early months, **Base has operated well below its potential capacity** most of the time. Daily transaction counts on Base have ranged in the hundreds of thousands – for example, ~150k–200k on typical days, and occasional peaks around 500–600k in a day ([Coinbase's Base Chain Warns of 'Stuck' Transactions Amid Traffic Surge](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/03/20/coinbases-base-chain-warns-of-stuck-transactions-amid-traffic-surge#:~:text=tokens%20designed%20to%20generate%20internet,driven%20subset%20of%20crypto%20enthusiasts)). Even the peaks, while 3× the normal volume, likely did not max out Base’s theoretical TPS capability. This means that **most Base blocks are not full** in day-to-day operation. In fact, Base often deliberately keeps blocks **small relative to what the tech allows**, to ensure stability and to not overload the Ethereum L1 with too much data. For instance, if Base’s block gas limit was initially set similar to Optimism’s or Ethereum’s, many blocks might only be partially filled under normal use. Only a surge of activity would push them to the limit. Empirical evidence: prior to any major “meme coin” craze, Base’s **gas utilization stayed around the target level or below**, and base fees remained low (a few gwei equivalent). Blocks being *under*-utilized was the norm – which is desirable for keeping user fees minimal. When Base’s activity increased dramatically (e.g. during a meme coin trading frenzy in early September 2023, and another in March 2024), we have seen blocks approach their gas limits, triggering the fee mechanism in earnest. In March 2024, Base usage spiked such that **transaction count tripled from ~200k/day to ~600k/day** and **Base Mainnet experienced high traffic with increasing fees** ([Coinbase's Base Chain Warns of 'Stuck' Transactions Amid Traffic Surge](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/03/20/coinbases-base-chain-warns-of-stuck-transactions-amid-traffic-surge#:~:text=tokens%20designed%20to%20generate%20internet,driven%20subset%20of%20crypto%20enthusiasts)) ([Coinbase's Base Chain Warns of 'Stuck' Transactions Amid Traffic Surge](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/03/20/coinbases-base-chain-warns-of-stuck-transactions-amid-traffic-surge#:~:text=,currently%20allow%20for%20transaction%20cancellation)). This implies blocks (or batches) were much fuller than usual, possibly hitting whatever gas per block target Base had configured. Base’s target utilization is likely 50% (as in Ethereum) of its *current* block gas limit – which itself is adjustable over time. So during that surge, blocks were consistently above the target (and perhaps at the max of ~2× target), causing the base fee to rise block after block.

**Fee Volatility on Base:** Under typical conditions, **Base’s base fee is very stable and low**. Because the network often runs under capacity, the base fee tends to sit at a steady level (only adjusting slightly up or down as usage flutters around the target). Users have generally enjoyed fees of just a few gwei on Base – significantly cheaper than Ethereum L1. However, Base is not immune to **volatility during demand spikes**. The March 2024 meme-coin craze demonstrated that when demand suddenly spikes, Base’s fees can escalate quickly. Coinbase had to warn users that **“fees [had] increased” and some transactions with too-low fees were stuck pending** due to congestion ([Coinbase's Base Chain Warns of 'Stuck' Transactions Amid Traffic Surge](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/03/20/coinbases-base-chain-warns-of-stuck-transactions-amid-traffic-surge#:~:text=200%2C000%20a%20day%2C%20since%20late,to%20over%20600%2C000%20on%20Monday)) ([Coinbase's Base Chain Warns of 'Stuck' Transactions Amid Traffic Surge](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/03/20/coinbases-base-chain-warns-of-stuck-transactions-amid-traffic-surge#:~:text=,currently%20allow%20for%20transaction%20cancellation)). In that episode, the base fee likely rose rapidly over a series of blocks until it reached a level that balanced the 3× higher transaction load. Users who had submitted transactions with a fixed low max fee found that those transactions would not be included until fees came back down, effectively creating a backlog of underpriced transactions. The base fee changes on Base are governed by the same 12.5% increment rule per block (assuming OP Stack didn’t alter this), so each block can only raise fees so fast. But if dozens of blocks in a row are full, a compounding effect kicks in. For example, if Base’s base fee was 1 gwei and suddenly every block is maxed out, after 10 blocks it could be ~3.3× higher, after 20 blocks ~11×, and so on. Over a short period (minutes), base fee could surge from essentially nil to tens of gwei. That appears to be what happened – **transactions that were previously fine (with low fee) got stuck** because the base fee overtook them ([Coinbase's Base Chain Warns of 'Stuck' Transactions Amid Traffic Surge](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/03/20/coinbases-base-chain-warns-of-stuck-transactions-amid-traffic-surge#:~:text=,currently%20allow%20for%20transaction%20cancellation)) ([Coinbase's Base Chain Warns of 'Stuck' Transactions Amid Traffic Surge](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/03/20/coinbases-base-chain-warns-of-stuck-transactions-amid-traffic-surge#:~:text=200%2C000%20a%20day%2C%20since%20late,to%20over%20600%2C000%20on%20Monday)). Once the surge in activity died down, fees would have dropped and those transactions could be processed (or users could cancel and resubmit them as advised). So, **Base’s fee volatility profile** is: *mostly flat* during normal times (thanks to lots of spare capacity), but **spiking during sudden high-demand events**. Importantly, Base’s development approach is to **increase throughput limits over time**, which can mitigate volatility. If Base sees sustained growth, instead of letting fees continually rise, they are likely to **raise the block gas limit or target** to accommodate more TPS. This happened implicitly when Base moved from testnet to mainnet with conservative settings, then opened up more after stability was proven. It’s similar to how Optimism and Arbitrum have occasionally raised their gas limits. Therefore, Base’s base fee volatility over the long term might remain low – they will adjust supply upward for planned growth – and only unpredictable *short bursts* will cause noticeable fee spikes.

**Demand vs. Supply Clearing:** The Base network’s ability to **clear congestion** is again EIP-1559-like: if there’s excessive demand, the base fee will climb until enough transactions are priced out to restore equilibrium. The March 2024 incident shows this mechanism working: Base processed significantly more transactions (so supply of block space went up to the max allowed), and fees rose to dampen the demand until only ~600k tx/day could get through ([Coinbase's Base Chain Warns of 'Stuck' Transactions Amid Traffic Surge](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/03/20/coinbases-base-chain-warns-of-stuck-transactions-amid-traffic-surge#:~:text=tokens%20designed%20to%20generate%20internet,driven%20subset%20of%20crypto%20enthusiasts)) ([Coinbase's Base Chain Warns of 'Stuck' Transactions Amid Traffic Surge](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/03/20/coinbases-base-chain-warns-of-stuck-transactions-amid-traffic-surge#:~:text=200%2C000%20a%20day%2C%20since%20late,to%20over%20600%2C000%20on%20Monday)). Some users were indeed left waiting (those who didn’t increase their fees), but the network itself kept throughput high and didn’t collapse. There was a backlog in the sense of pending low-fee tx, but not an uncontrollable one – once fees stabilized at a higher level, each new block still cleared incoming tx at that price. It’s also telling that Coinbase **encouraged users to cancel and resubmit with higher fees** ([Coinbase's Base Chain Warns of 'Stuck' Transactions Amid Traffic Surge](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/03/20/coinbases-base-chain-warns-of-stuck-transactions-amid-traffic-surge#:~:text=200%2C000%20a%20day%2C%20since%20late,to%20over%20600%2C000%20on%20Monday)), indicating that the congestion was being actively cleared by the higher fee requirement. Base’s design as a *centralized sequencer* L2 also helps here: there’s no auction among multiple miners – a single sequencer can reorder and prioritize easily. If users attach higher fees (tips), the sequencer will include those first. In extreme cases, Base could even choose to **increase the gas limit on the fly** (if the software and governance allow) to push more transactions through; however, that’s usually done cautiously to maintain L1 posting constraints. Generally, **Base does not suffer persistent congestion** because of its mandate to scale. If Base consistently ran at, say, 90%+ capacity and fees were rising often, the team would likely expand capacity (subject to Ethereum data limits). In current reality, outside of sudden frenzies, **Base’s supply (block space) comfortably meets demand**, and the base fee remains at a low equilibrium. This means **no persistent mempool backlog** – transactions clear within a block or two when the network isn’t overwhelmed. It’s only those rare high-demand surges where you see a temporary pile-up and higher gas prices, which then get resolved as the surge abates or users bid up. 

One more nuance: Base’s **total transaction cost** includes the L1 data fee. During Ethereum congestion, that L1 fee can shoot up regardless of Base’s own usage. So Base users might see their fees vary due to external factors. For instance, if Ethereum gas prices double, the cost to post Base’s call data doubles, which is passed to Base users. This is **outside the EIP-1559 model on Base** (it’s just a fixed per-byte cost), but it affects user experience. Base tries to **hide this complexity** with good gas estimation ([Base 101: How Gas Works On Base](https://www.blocknative.com/blog/base-101-how-gas-works-on-base-1#:~:text=This%20is%20where%20Blocknative%E2%80%99s%20Gas,on%20what%20they%20do%20best%E2%80%A6building)). However, in a scenario where Ethereum is very busy (raising data prices) and Base is also very busy (raising L2 execution fees), the total fee volatility can be a combination of both. Typically, though, the L1 fee dominates, and Base’s own fee is a minor portion.

**Fee Mechanism Quirks:** Base’s EIP-1559 implementation is standard, with **no custom floor or cap** enforced on the base fee. If Base’s activity ever dropped extremely low, the base fee would keep dropping (though practically it may bottom out at 0.1 nanoETH or something due to minute precision). If activity exploded, the base fee would keep rising each block until perhaps users simply stop sending tx because the fees approach L1 costs. Base doesn’t burn the fees in the same way Ethereum does (since there’s no separate token economics – essentially the ETH paid on Base can be used by the sequencer to cover L1 costs and the rest could be profit). Coinbase hasn’t published details, but likely **Base burns the L2 base fee portion or escrow it (making it unrecoverable)** to mimic Ethereum’s monetary policy, while the priority fee might go to the sequencer as revenue. This is somewhat conjectural; what matters for the fee market is that **transactions are ordered by fee** just like on Ethereum: the sequencer will include any tx whose `maxFeePerGas >= current base fee` (and highest tips get priority if block space is scarce) ([Transaction Fees | Avalanche Builder Hub](https://build.avax.network/docs/api-reference/guides/txn-fees#:~:text=The%20fee%20cap%20specifies%20the,and%20the%20gas%20tip%20cap)) ([Transaction Fees | Avalanche Builder Hub](https://build.avax.network/docs/api-reference/guides/txn-fees#:~:text=Transactions%20are%20ordered%20by%20the,oldest%20first)). We saw evidence of this when low-fee tx got stuck – the sequencer prioritized those who paid the **latest going rate**. In extreme congestion, **Base essentially reverts to a first-price auction on the priority fee** (since everyone will be paying the high base fee, the tip becomes the differentiator) similar to Ethereum’s behavior when blocks are full ([Analysis of EIP-1559 - Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/analysis-of-eip-1559/#:~:text=As%20blocks%20approach%20the%20cap,to%20pay%20BASEFEE%20or%20not)). So the fee market logic is consistent across Ethereum L1 and Base L2. The difference is Base can ultimately **scale supply** by increasing its block gas limit, which is a lever not available on a decentralized L1 without a hard fork. Coinbase can adjust Base’s parameters unilaterally. In fact, the **long-term plan to reach 1 Ggas/sec** implies they will keep raising block sizes. This means that *for the USDC subnet, which might have similar goals of high throughput*, Base provides a case study of balancing raising capacity versus letting fees spike. Base’s empirical data shows mostly **under-utilization with low fees** punctuated by occasional **demand shocks that caused higher fees and brief backlogs** ([Coinbase's Base Chain Warns of 'Stuck' Transactions Amid Traffic Surge](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/03/20/coinbases-base-chain-warns-of-stuck-transactions-amid-traffic-surge#:~:text=tokens%20designed%20to%20generate%20internet,driven%20subset%20of%20crypto%20enthusiasts)). The network remained stable during those shocks, and going forward Base will likely alleviate such shocks by **increasing capacity headroom** in advance (if they anticipate growth). 

## Comparative Analysis of EIP-1559 Implementations  

To summarize and compare these three implementations side by side:

- **Block Utilization & Full Blocks:** Ethereum targets 50% utilization and achieves roughly that on average ([Transaction Fees on a Honeymoon: Ethereum&#x0027;s EIP-1559 One Month Later](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/180741021/Transaction_Fees_on_a_Honeymoon_Ethereums_EIP_1559_One_Month_Later.pdf#:~:text=,which)). Only about **1 in 5 blocks** ends up completely full in Ethereum’s recent history ([Empirical Analysis of EIP-1559: Transaction Fees, Waiting Times, and Consensus Security](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05574#:~:text=%28b%29%20Approximately%2020,Distribution%20of%20Block%20Gas%20Used)), though during peak hours or events that fraction can temporarily rise. Avalanche initially targeted a much lower utilization (25%), resulting in many blocks only quarter-full at equilibrium; after adjustments, it targets ~37.5% and can use more of its capacity without fee hikes ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=Ava%20Labs%20quickly%20responded%20to,as%20gas%20consumption%20has%20increased)). Avalanche often runs far below max capacity in normal times – many blocks are mostly empty (just a few basic transactions) with the base fee at the minimum, indicating **ample spare room** ([Etna: Enhancing the Sovereignty of Avalanche L1 Networks | Avalanche Blog](https://www.avax.network/blog/etna-enhancing-the-sovereignty-of-avalanche-l1-networks#:~:text=This%20upgrade%20activates%20ACP,during%20periods%20of%20low%20activity)) ([ACP-125: Reduce C-Chain minimum base fee from 25 nAVAX to 1 nAVAX · avalanche-foundation ACPs · Discussion #127 · GitHub](https://github.com/avalanche-foundation/ACPs/discussions/127#:~:text=1,transactions%2C%20benefiting%20the%20entire%20ecosystem)). Base typically operates with **significant spare capacity** as well, given its scaling roadmap. On ordinary days, Base’s blocks are not constrained; only a small fraction of blocks (if any) hit the limit. In rare traffic surges, Base did see blocks at max capacity for a period, similar to Ethereum’s behavior under stress ([Coinbase's Base Chain Warns of 'Stuck' Transactions Amid Traffic Surge](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/03/20/coinbases-base-chain-warns-of-stuck-transactions-amid-traffic-surge#:~:text=tokens%20designed%20to%20generate%20internet,driven%20subset%20of%20crypto%20enthusiasts)). In short, **Ethereum and Base both aim for ~50% usage**, but Ethereum actually runs closer to that limit more frequently (due to continual high L1 demand), whereas Base usually runs well under (since it’s newer and scaling up). Avalanche’s target was lower, leading to fewer full blocks by design, though after raising it, it’s more comparable. In congestion events, *all* three can produce runs of full blocks (Ethereum and Base until price equilibrium is reached, Avalanche until it hits its cap or demand falls).

- **Fee Volatility:** Ethereum’s base fee is somewhat volatile in the **short term** – it can **change every block** and has shown “intense” oscillations during fast-changing demand ([Transaction Fees on a Honeymoon: Ethereum&#x0027;s EIP-1559 One Month Later](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/180741021/Transaction_Fees_on_a_Honeymoon_Ethereums_EIP_1559_One_Month_Later.pdf#:~:text=evaluate%20the%20impact%20of%20EIP,alternative%20base%20fee%20adjustment%20rule)). However, over longer periods it tends to stabilize around a level (until the next big demand change). Avalanche’s base fee has been **less volatile** block-to-block, thanks to averaging and a deliberately looser policy on utilization. Empirical results after Avalanche’s AP5 upgrade showed a **smoother fee curve with lower peaks** even as usage grew ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=representing%20block%20utilization%20of%2025,as%20gas%20consumption%20has%20increased)). Avalanche’s fee also cannot drop or spike beyond its configured floor/ceiling, which bounds volatility. Base’s fee volatility has mostly been low (the network often sits at a steady low fee), but it **spikes when triggered by a sudden surge**, similar to Ethereum’s pattern. The difference is that Base’s team may respond by increasing capacity, whereas Ethereum must let fees do all the work. In the March 2024 case, Base’s fees tripled and more within a day ([Coinbase's Base Chain Warns of 'Stuck' Transactions Amid Traffic Surge](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/03/20/coinbases-base-chain-warns-of-stuck-transactions-amid-traffic-surge#:~:text=200%2C000%20a%20day%2C%20since%20late,to%20over%20600%2C000%20on%20Monday)), showing that despite being an L2, it can face short-term fee turbulence akin to an L1 if usage overshoots. In summary, **Avalanche offers the smoothest fee behavior** under most conditions (deliberately dampened changes), **Ethereum has moderate volatility** (generally stable except for short bursts), and **Base has low volatility most of the time and sharp spikes on rare occasions** (with plans to mitigate by scaling). All three systems successfully avoid the wild West of first-price auctions (pre-1559) where fee estimates were extremely unpredictable; users on each chain can usually rely on the base fee mechanism to quote a fairly stable price, except during those high-demand moments. 

- **Congestion Management & Backlogs:** All three networks use the **base fee rise to clear congestion**. In Ethereum, when demand > supply, we see rapid base fee increases until the transaction influx slows – effectively clearing the excess demand by pricing some out ([Analysis of EIP-1559 - Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/analysis-of-eip-1559/#:~:text=State%20of%20occasional%20congestion%3A%20As,BASEFEE%20will%20start%20to%20decline)). Avalanche does similarly, but it started with a throttled supply (25% target) which made it enter congestion pricing earlier; when that proved too limiting, it boosted supply (target 15M) to accommodate more transactions before congestion pricing kicks in ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=Ava%20Labs%20quickly%20responded%20to,as%20gas%20consumption%20has%20increased)). Avalanche also had an upper fee cap, so in worst-case scenarios beyond that, it would accumulate a backlog (since it couldn’t raise fees further). Thus Avalanche’s strategy to congestion has been *preventative*: add capacity or adjust parameters so that genuine congestion is rare and short-lived. Indeed, when fees spiked and swaps became expensive in November 2021, that situation was resolved by **increasing throughput (AP5)** rather than letting the fee stay high for long ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=Ava%20Labs%20quickly%20responded%20to,as%20gas%20consumption%20has%20increased)). Base’s approach is somewhat between Ethereum and Avalanche. Base will let fees rise to deal with a sudden surge (just like Ethereum), but over the medium term, it will likely **raise its gas limit** if usage remains high. Base did experience backlogs of low-fee transactions during its traffic surge – Coinbase noted some user transactions were stuck pending until fees came down or were resubmitted ([Coinbase's Base Chain Warns of 'Stuck' Transactions Amid Traffic Surge](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/03/20/coinbases-base-chain-warns-of-stuck-transactions-amid-traffic-surge#:~:text=,currently%20allow%20for%20transaction%20cancellation)) ([Coinbase's Base Chain Warns of 'Stuck' Transactions Amid Traffic Surge](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/03/20/coinbases-base-chain-warns-of-stuck-transactions-amid-traffic-surge#:~:text=200%2C000%20a%20day%2C%20since%20late,to%20over%20600%2C000%20on%20Monday)). That’s the same as on Ethereum: if you don’t increase your gas price during a spike, you wait. Avalanche’s users historically had a different experience – many of them always paid at least the floor (which was relatively high initially), and the network rarely had prolonged pending tx issues aside from some moments when the fee hit the cap. Generally, **none of these networks sees persistent congestion** in normal operation: Ethereum clears it via fees (albeit at the cost of very high fees at times), Avalanche by a combination of fees and expanding capacity, and Base by fees in the short term and planned capacity growth in the long term. It’s also worth noting **latency**: Avalanche finalizes transactions very fast (sub-second), Base and Ethereum have to wait for L1 confirmations (12s or more). But that’s more about consensus than fee. From a fee market perspective, **all three achieve equilibrium** – there’s no evidence of perma-backlog where transactions wait hours despite willing payers. The only ones that wait are those purposely not bidding the going rate.

- **Fee Smoothing & Special Mechanisms:** Ethereum’s implementation is straightforward: 12.5% adjustment per block, no averaging, no floors/caps (aside from trivial floor of 0). Avalanche introduced **several special mechanisms**: a rolling window to smooth usage measurement ([Apricot Phase Three: C-Chain Dynamic Fees | by Patrick O'Grady | Avalanche | Medium](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/apricot-phase-three-c-chain-dynamic-fees-432d32d67b60#:~:text=Because%20block%20production%20is%20asynchronous,as%20the%20block%20content%20itself)), a **minimum base fee** (floor) that was sometimes adjusted via upgrades ([Etna: Enhancing the Sovereignty of Avalanche L1 Networks | Avalanche Blog](https://www.avax.network/blog/etna-enhancing-the-sovereignty-of-avalanche-l1-networks#:~:text=This%20upgrade%20activates%20ACP,during%20periods%20of%20low%20activity)), and an initial **max fee cap** to ensure compatibility and fee sanity ([Apricot Phase Three: C-Chain Dynamic Fees | by Patrick O'Grady | Avalanche | Medium](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/apricot-phase-three-c-chain-dynamic-fees-432d32d67b60#:~:text=minimum%20gas%20price%20decreases,as%20has%20been)). Avalanche also burns all fees (including tips) ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=Transaction%20fees%20on%20the%20C,the%20miners)), which is unique. Base’s mechanism, as far as the public knows, does not deviate from Ethereum’s in terms of algorithm – it likely also does a per-block 12.5% update (or per L2 block, which might be a sequence of L2 tx included in one L1 batch). Base has no publicly stated fee floor or cap. That said, the Base team can *manually intervene* if needed – for example, they could decide to not let base fee drop below X to avoid spam, or they could throttle the sequencer if gas prices went insanely high, but these are not baked-in protocol rules, just operational decisions. In practice, Base has functioned just like Ethereum’s model, with the addition of *off-chain guidance*: they provide a **Gas Oracle API** to help estimate the L1 data fee and appropriate L2 tip ([Base 101: How Gas Works On Base](https://www.blocknative.com/blog/base-101-how-gas-works-on-base-1#:~:text=This%20is%20where%20Blocknative%E2%80%99s%20Gas,on%20what%20they%20do%20best%E2%80%A6building)) ([Base 101: How Gas Works On Base](https://www.blocknative.com/blog/base-101-how-gas-works-on-base-1#:~:text=The%20primary%20intention%20of%20EIP,into%20its%20network%20fee%20structure)). For our comparison: **Avalanche stands out for its fee floor and time-window smoothing**, **Ethereum for its simplicity and pure algorithmic approach**, and **Base for combining EIP-1559 with massive scalability potential** (and the dual fee component). Avalanche’s experience shows the effect of these tweaks: a fee floor can **prevent extremely low fees and idle spam** (but if set too high, it can under-utilize capacity ([ACP-125: Reduce C-Chain minimum base fee from 25 nAVAX to 1 nAVAX · avalanche-foundation ACPs · Discussion #127 · GitHub](https://github.com/avalanche-foundation/ACPs/discussions/127#:~:text=1,transactions%2C%20benefiting%20the%20entire%20ecosystem))), and a rolling average can reduce fee jitter. Ethereum’s experience shows that even without fancy smoothing, the basic mechanism works well on average, though it allows more bursty behavior. Base’s experience underscores that **scaling out capacity is a powerful complement to the fee mechanism** – by raising block gas limits, Base can keep fees low without needing to frequently exercise the base fee increases.

In essence, these networks present a spectrum from **highly algorithm-driven (Ethereum)** to **algorithm + proactive tuning (Avalanche)** to **algorithm + proactive scaling (Base)**. All burn the base fee to remove it from circulation (ETH or AVAX), aligning economic incentives.

## Recommendations for a USDC-Based Avalanche Subnet (PoA L1) Gas Fee Mechanism  

Using the above insights, we now recommend specific parameters and design choices for a **USDC-centric Avalanche Subnet L1** (Proof-of-Authority consensus) that prioritizes **stability and predictability of gas fees**. The goal is to maintain consistently low fees for USDC transactions, avoid volatile spikes, and ensure the fee mechanism smoothly handles both low and high demand. 

**1. Implement an EIP-1559-Style Dynamic Fee with Moderato Smoothing:**  
Adopt the **same core mechanism of a base fee that adjusts with network usage**. Given that this is an Avalanche subnet, you can leverage Avalanche’s **Moderato algorithm** (already battle-tested on C-Chain) to compute the base fee. That means using a **rolling time window (e.g. 10 seconds)** to measure gas used, and increasing or decreasing the base fee based on the ratio of usage to a **target gas** for that window ([Apricot Phase Three: C-Chain Dynamic Fees | by Patrick O'Grady | Avalanche | Medium](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/apricot-phase-three-c-chain-dynamic-fees-432d32d67b60#:~:text=Because%20block%20production%20is%20asynchronous,as%20the%20block%20content%20itself)) ([Apricot Phase Three: C-Chain Dynamic Fees | by Patrick O'Grady | Avalanche | Medium](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/apricot-phase-three-c-chain-dynamic-fees-432d32d67b60#:~:text=window%20of%20activity%2C%20where%20block,as%20the%20block%20content%20itself)). This will automatically raise fees when the subnet is busy and lower them when it’s idle. By using the Moderato approach, you also inherit its **smoothing benefits** – short-term bursts won’t create as much fee whiplash because the algorithm looks at cumulative usage over several seconds, not a single block. This is ideal for a PoA subnet where block production might be very fast; a time-based metric avoids the fee jumping around if multiple blocks are produced in a second or if block timing isn’t uniform. In short, **embrace EIP-1559’s dynamic fee logic with Avalanche’s enhancements**: a moving average utilization and fee updates on each window. This gives you **predictable fees** for users and an automated way to throttle spam if needed.

**2. Set a High Throughput and Generous Gas Target (Avoid Underutilization Constraints):**  
One of the most important parameters is the **gas usage target**. We recommend configuring the subnet for **relatively high throughput** and setting the target utilization to around **50% of that capacity** (similar to Ethereum’s philosophy) ([Transaction Fees on a Honeymoon: Ethereum&#x0027;s EIP-1559 One Month Later](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/180741021/Transaction_Fees_on_a_Honeymoon_Ethereums_EIP_1559_One_Month_Later.pdf#:~:text=,which)). Unlike Avalanche’s initial 25% target, which was too low and caused unnecessary fee hikes ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=Ava%20Labs%20quickly%20responded%20to,as%20gas%20consumption%20has%20increased)), a 50% target allows the network to handle large volumes before fees even start to rise significantly. Concretely: if your PoA validators can comfortably handle, say, 2 million gas per second of execution, set the target to ~1 million gas/sec (which over a 10s window would be 10 million gas). This means the base fee will remain at its minimum as long as the subnet is processing ≤1M gas/sec on average. Only if it consistently exceeds that (up to 2M gas/sec max) will the fee begin climbing. **Empirical reasoning:** Ethereum’s half-full target has kept blocks from being constantly maxed out and provided flexibility ([Transaction Fees on a Honeymoon: Ethereum&#x0027;s EIP-1559 One Month Later](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/180741021/Transaction_Fees_on_a_Honeymoon_Ethereums_EIP_1559_One_Month_Later.pdf#:~:text=,which)), whereas Avalanche’s 25% target led to “artificially reduced network usage” and high fees until they raised it ([ACP-125: Reduce C-Chain minimum base fee from 25 nAVAX to 1 nAVAX · avalanche-foundation ACPs · Discussion #127 · GitHub](https://github.com/avalanche-foundation/ACPs/discussions/127#:~:text=1,transactions%2C%20benefiting%20the%20entire%20ecosystem)). For a stablecoin chain, it’s crucial that typical activity (perhaps thousands of USDC transfers per second, depending on adoption) is well below the congestion threshold. You want to **minimize the chances of hitting the fee increase trigger** during normal operation. Thus, err on the side of a **larger block capacity** with a moderate target ratio. In practice, you might start with a somewhat conservative gas limit but monitor usage closely – if you find you’re always under target (base fee never budging off min), you’re fine. If you find you’re frequently hitting target and base fee is rising, that’s a sign to *increase capacity*. Since this is a PoA chain under your control, you have the freedom to **scale vertically** (increase gas per block) as needed, much like Base plans to do ([Base Gas Target & Throughput](https://dune.com/lifewillbeokay/base-gas-target-and-throughput#:~:text=Base%20Gas%20Target%20%26%20Throughput,to%20reach%201%20Ggas%2Fs%20throughput)). The guiding principle: **supply of block space should comfortably exceed expected demand** to keep fees steady. Use ~50% target utilization as a baseline for the algorithm to keep itself centered.

**3. Use the Standard Base Fee Adjustment Rate (12.5% per Interval), but Consider Longer Windows if Needed:**  
Avalanche’s Moderato and Ethereum both use a **“learning rate” of 12.5%** for fee adjustments (meaning if utilization is double the target, fee goes up 12.5%; if half the target, fee goes down ~12.5%, per interval) ([Analysis of EIP-1559 - Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/analysis-of-eip-1559/#:~:text=State%20of%20extended%20congestion%3A%20It,initial%20BASEFEE%20%3D%201%20Gwei)) ([Transaction Fees on a Honeymoon: Ethereum&#x0027;s EIP-1559 One Month Later](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/180741021/Transaction_Fees_on_a_Honeymoon_Ethereums_EIP_1559_One_Month_Later.pdf#:~:text=size%20%28half,which)). We recommend sticking to this **0.125 (12.5%) adjustment factor** for the subnet, as it has proven to strike a good balance between responsiveness and stability. A higher rate would make fees jump more abruptly, and a significantly lower rate might make the fee slow to respond (potentially allowing longer backlogs). The 12.5% has become a de-facto standard. However, you do have the knob of the **window length**: Avalanche uses 10 seconds, but you could consider a slightly longer window (say 30 seconds) if you find that even 10s is too reactive for your stability preference. A longer window would further smooth out momentary bursts (making fee changes more gradual), at the cost of slower reaction to sustained load changes. Given that USDC transactions may come in bursts (e.g., large batch of payments at top of the hour) but you want a stable fee, a **30-second rolling window** could be tested. This would aggregate more blocks’ data and lead to smaller per-step adjustments. That said, a 10s window is already quite smooth and has worked well on Avalanche ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=representing%20block%20utilization%20of%2025,as%20gas%20consumption%20has%20increased)), so it’s safe to start there. In summary, use **Moderato with its default learning rate** (keep that 12.5% per adjustment interval) to ensure the fee updates are **gentle, not jagged**. Only tweak the interval or rate if you observe undesirable oscillations. 

**4. Establish a Low *but Non-Zero* Minimum Base Fee (Fee Floor):**  
To ensure **stability and security**, configure a **minimum base fee** value > 0 for the subnet. As Avalanche’s experience showed, having a floor prevents the network from dropping to effectively free transactions which could invite spam or bloating the chain with dust tx. We recommend setting the min base fee very low – on the order of what Avalanche did post-Etna: e.g., **1e-9 of the gas token** per gas (if USDC is the gas token, this depends on decimals, but conceptually a tiny fraction of a cent) ([Etna: Enhancing the Sovereignty of Avalanche L1 Networks | Avalanche Blog](https://www.avax.network/blog/etna-enhancing-the-sovereignty-of-avalanche-l1-networks#:~:text=This%20upgrade%20activates%20ACP,during%20periods%20of%20low%20activity)). For a USDC-based chain, you might denominate gas in a fraction of USDC (for example, if 1 USDC is 10^6 “microUSDC”, you could set min base fee = 10 microUSDC per gas, which is $0.00001 per gas). The exact number should be chosen based on expected gas consumption of typical transactions and the desired minimum transaction cost. For instance, if a simple USDC transfer costs ~21,000 gas, at 10 microUSDC/gas that’s about 0.21 USDC cents ($0.0021) per transfer – extremely cheap. You could go even lower (Avalanche’s 1 nAVAX gas was ~$0.00000004 per gas unit ([One of the Biggest Altcoins Announces Its Largest Update Ever](https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/6c64f5c4-2d30-495a-8f2d-bcbda2c048e2#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20Biggest%20Altcoins,smart%20contracts%20on%20the)), making a 21k gas tx cost ~$0.00084!). The key is to have *some* floor to **limit spam**. Even at Avalanche’s new floor, the network didn’t see issues – it actually *unleashed* more usage that was suppressed by the older higher floor ([ACP-125: Reduce C-Chain minimum base fee from 25 nAVAX to 1 nAVAX · avalanche-foundation ACPs · Discussion #127 · GitHub](https://github.com/avalanche-foundation/ACPs/discussions/127#:~:text=1,transactions%2C%20benefiting%20the%20entire%20ecosystem)). So the lesson is: don’t make the floor high (that reduces usage and hurts efficiency), but do have a minimal fee that requires would-be spammers to burn some value. We suggest a floor such that a minimal transaction (say one transfer) costs on the order of **fractions of a penny**. This will be practically free for legitimate users but still imposes cost on anyone trying to flood the network with millions of tx. **Implementing the floor** in the EIP-1559 code is straightforward (Avalanche’s code already has `minBaseFee` you can set). This ensures during low demand, the base fee **“approaches the minBaseFee”** but never goes below it ([Etna: Enhancing the Sovereignty of Avalanche L1 Networks | Avalanche Blog](https://www.avax.network/blog/etna-enhancing-the-sovereignty-of-avalanche-l1-networks#:~:text=cheaper%20during%20periods%20of%20low,activity)). Thus, your users benefit from *significantly cheaper transactions during low activity* ([Etna: Enhancing the Sovereignty of Avalanche L1 Networks | Avalanche Blog](https://www.avax.network/blog/etna-enhancing-the-sovereignty-of-avalanche-l1-networks#:~:text=This%20upgrade%20activates%20ACP,during%20periods%20of%20low%20activity)), and the network remains protected from completely costless spam. 

**5. Consider a Base Fee Ceiling or Other Rate Limit as a Stability Backstop:**  
While the ideal scenario is to always meet demand, it’s wise to plan for worst-case **surge scenarios**. On a stablecoin network, you might decide there’s an upper fee that’s acceptable (beyond which it’s better to let transactions queue than to charge exorbitant fees). Avalanche originally set a max of 225 nAVAX (225 gwei) for base fee ([Apricot Phase Three: C-Chain Dynamic Fees | by Patrick O'Grady | Avalanche | Medium](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/apricot-phase-three-c-chain-dynamic-fees-432d32d67b60#:~:text=minimum%20gas%20price%20decreases,as%20has%20been)). For your USDC subnet, you could similarly set a **maximum base fee** (for example, maybe the equivalent of say $1.00 per gas unit, just as a safeguard). If a catastrophic event causes demand to skyrocket (perhaps an attack or some integration gone rogue), the base fee would climb but **stop at the cap**. This prevents users from facing unbounded costs. However, note that **if the cap is reached, congestion will no longer be addressed by fee increases**, so a backlog will grow until demand falls or the cap is raised. This is essentially a policy decision: do you prefer **unbounded fees but no backlog** (the Ethereum approach), or **capped fees but possible backlog** (the Avalanche approach in early days)? For a chain emphasizing stability (especially if users are retail, who can’t tolerate huge fees), a cap makes sense. It sets an upper predictable limit on fees. You could set it quite high to only ever engage in extreme situations – e.g. a cap that a normal user would never hit unless the network is under attack. Avalanche’s 225 gwei was about 3× the normal gas price at the time. You might choose, for instance, a cap that corresponds to, say, **5 USDC per 1M gas** (just illustrative) – then a standard transfer (21k gas) would never cost more than $0.105 no matter what. Choose this threshold based on what’s an “unacceptably high” fee for your use case. The existence of a cap also forces you to have **contingency plans for congestion**: if it’s hit, you either let the backlog sit or **scale the network** (e.g. speed up block production or increase block gas limit on-the-fly, since PoA allows coordination). In a PoA setting, hitting a fee cap could even trigger an automated response like alerting operators to add more validator nodes or increase capacity. So, our recommendation is: **include a fee cap** as a safety valve – it’s a form of stability (fees won’t blow past a known level). Keep it high enough that under normal surges the network might not hit it (so the base fee mechanism still does its job), but low enough to protect users from absurd costs. This way, **fee spikes are inherently limited**. (If you prefer not to hard-cap, an alternative is to program a **damped increase** once fees get very high – e.g. beyond a certain fee, reduce the adjustment rate to slow further growth. But a hard cap is simpler and was effectively used by Avalanche with no ill effects).

**6. Use Priority Fees for Transaction Ordering, Burn the Base Fee (and possibly Priority) to Maintain Stability:**  
Following EIP-1559 conventions, transactions should specify a **max fee and a priority fee (tip)** ([Transaction Fees | Avalanche Builder Hub](https://build.avax.network/docs/api-reference/guides/txn-fees#:~:text=The%20fee%20cap%20specifies%20the,and%20the%20gas%20tip%20cap)). In normal conditions, users can just use a minimal tip and pay the base fee. Under congestion (when blocks are full relative to target), the **priority fee ensures urgent transactions can still get in first** ([Transaction Fees | Avalanche Builder Hub](https://build.avax.network/docs/api-reference/guides/txn-fees#:~:text=Transactions%20are%20ordered%20by%20the,oldest%20first)). On Ethereum/Base, miners/sequencers earn the tip, which incentivizes them to include those transactions. On your PoA subnet, validators might not care about earning USDC fees (and you might not want to create an incentive to deviate from the base fee fairness). It could be wise to **follow Avalanche’s model and burn the priority fee as well** ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=Transaction%20fees%20on%20the%20C,the%20miners)), or send it to a community treasury, rather than give it to validators. This keeps the validators’ role purely to order and execute transactions (they likely have other compensation if needed, or maybe they don’t need any given it’s PoA). By **burning the base fee** (which is standard in EIP-1559) you remove that USDC from circulation (which is interesting because USDC is not usually burnable, but if USDC is the gas, those fees could be sent to an unspendable address or something). Burning might not be ideal for a fiat-backed stablecoin, so alternatively, you could collect the base fees into a fee sink or governance-controlled address (effectively taking them out of user hands). The main thing is to *not* recycle base fees back to transaction senders or validators, or you lose the fee market effect. So, **ensure the base fee paid is indeed taken out of the transaction flow** (just as ETH or AVAX base fees are burned) ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=Transaction%20fees%20on%20the%20C,the%20miners)). For priority fees: since stability (and low fees) is the goal, you likely expect priority fees to remain low. But if there’s a sudden rush, a bit of first-price auction on tips might occur ([Analysis of EIP-1559 - Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/analysis-of-eip-1559/#:~:text=As%20blocks%20approach%20the%20cap,to%20pay%20BASEFEE%20or%20not)). That’s okay, as long as it’s only temporary. Because it’s PoA, you might not want validators profiting off that (it could create perverse incentives to artificially congest the network). So burning the tips as well (as Avalanche does) removes any conflict of interest ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=Transaction%20fees%20on%20the%20C,the%20miners)). This design keeps the **fee mechanism focused on regulating demand** and not on rewarding block producers. It also has the side effect of **making USDC deflationary** in the context of your subnet, which might be fine if fees are negligible, or you could periodically re-inject burned USDC via some governance (that’s more on the economic side). From a technical perspective: implement the EIP-1559 transaction format (already in Avalanche’s Subnet-EVM code) with `maxFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas` fields, and adopt the same inclusion logic: a transaction pays `baseFee + priority` (or less if `maxFee` is the limiting factor), where base goes to burn and priority is optional for speed ([Transaction Fees | Avalanche Builder Hub](https://build.avax.network/docs/api-reference/guides/txn-fees#:~:text=The%20fee%20cap%20specifies%20the,and%20the%20gas%20tip%20cap)) ([Transaction Fees | Avalanche Builder Hub](https://build.avax.network/docs/api-reference/guides/txn-fees#:~:text=Transactions%20are%20ordered%20by%20the,oldest%20first)). This will give users the **option to expedite transactions** if the network is congested by adding a tip, while normal users can just pay the base fee price for regular speed. It’s a fair system that has worked well on all networks examined.

**7. Proactively Monitor and **Scale the Network’s Gas Limits** to Maintain Low Fees:**  
Perhaps the biggest advantage you have with a PoA subnet is agility – you can adjust parameters on-the-fly by agreement of the authority nodes. You should plan to **monitor gas usage, base fee levels, and transaction latency closely**. Set thresholds for action. For example, if you notice that the base fee has been rising and averaging significantly above the minimum for some sustained period (say, an hour or a day) because demand is consistently high, that’s a signal that **demand is outpacing your target supply**. Rather than allowing fees to continue to rise and users to suffer high costs, you can **increase the gas per block or per second** so that the target utilization now corresponds to a higher absolute throughput. This is exactly what Avalanche did moving from AP3 to AP5 – when fees grew and users complained, they *increased the target gas by 50%* to bring fees down ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=Ava%20Labs%20quickly%20responded%20to,as%20gas%20consumption%20has%20increased)). Base similarly aims to *raise throughput* as its user base grows ([Base Gas Target & Throughput](https://dune.com/lifewillbeokay/base-gas-target-and-throughput#:~:text=Base%20Gas%20Target%20%26%20Throughput,to%20reach%201%20Ggas%2Fs%20throughput)). You should do the same for the USDC subnet: treat the initial parameters as flexible. If, for instance, you started with 1M gas/second target and find out a year later that usage is double and base fee has crept up, consider raising the target to 2M gas/second (assuming validators can handle it). This will push the base fee back down and restore stability. The **emphasis is on stability**: you want fees to remain as close to flat as possible, only using price surges as a short-term mechanism. In a stablecoin network, consistent low fees will encourage adoption (as noted by Avalanche community when arguing to lower the min fee to increase usage) ([ACP-125: Reduce C-Chain minimum base fee from 25 nAVAX to 1 nAVAX · avalanche-foundation ACPs · Discussion #127 · GitHub](https://github.com/avalanche-foundation/ACPs/discussions/127#:~:text=1,transactions%2C%20benefiting%20the%20entire%20ecosystem)) ([ACP-125: Reduce C-Chain minimum base fee from 25 nAVAX to 1 nAVAX · avalanche-foundation ACPs · Discussion #127 · GitHub](https://github.com/avalanche-foundation/ACPs/discussions/127#:~:text=and%20potentially%20higher%20network%20usage,the%20network%E2%80%99s%20stability%20or%20performance)). So, plan for **capacity upgrades**. This might involve adding validator nodes (if that helps throughput), optimizing code, or simply upping config values if current ones were conservative. A practical recommendation is to set up **dashboard alerts**: e.g., if average gas used per 10s window exceeds, say, 80% of target for more than X minutes, alert the ops team. Or if base fee has climbed above some small multiple of min (maybe 2× min) for a sustained period, it means the network is congesting. With such monitoring, you can react before users feel too much pain. Over time, as USDC transactions possibly skyrocket, you might repeatedly raise capacity – similar to how off-chain payment networks scale. The end result could be a subnet that can handle huge volume with only tiny, occasional fee fluctuations. This essentially follows **Base’s path of scaling instead of letting fees grow uncontrolled** (Base kept fees low and intends to boost capacity to handle more) and **Avalanche’s quick mitigations** to keep fees reasonable ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=Ava%20Labs%20quickly%20responded%20to,as%20gas%20consumption%20has%20increased)). Keep in mind any limits imposed by hardware or the underlying Avalanche consensus – but PoA with a known set of validators can likely push pretty high throughput with modern servers. 

**8. Maintain Governance Control for Fee Parameter Tweaks:**  
Even with the best initial parameters, reality can bring surprises. It’s prudent to have a **governance or admin process for adjusting fee algorithm parameters** on the fly (or semi-automatically). For example, if you observe oscillations in fees that are too jagged, you might decide to lengthen the averaging window or lower the 12.5% rate a bit. Or if fees aren’t decaying fast enough after a congestion event, you might want to increase the decay rate. The research on Ethereum fee markets suggests alternatives like variable adjustment rates could improve stability ([Transaction Fees on a Honeymoon: Ethereum&#x0027;s EIP-1559 One Month Later](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/180741021/Transaction_Fees_on_a_Honeymoon_Ethereums_EIP_1559_One_Month_Later.pdf#:~:text=although%20EIP,Our)), but those are experimental. For now, parameters like target gas, block gas limit, min fee, max fee, etc., should be tunable via governance. **Avalanche’s own upgrades (Apricot, Etna)** were essentially governance-driven parameter changes (and some code changes) to refine the fee mechanism ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=set%20the%20target%20gas%20to,state%20growth%20problems%20as%20Ethereum)) ([Etna: Enhancing the Sovereignty of Avalanche L1 Networks | Avalanche Blog](https://www.avax.network/blog/etna-enhancing-the-sovereignty-of-avalanche-l1-networks#:~:text=This%20upgrade%20activates%20ACP,during%20periods%20of%20low%20activity)). You should be prepared to do the same. For example, if the min fee you set (say 10 microUSDC) is still higher than what the market demands (maybe you find the network could handle even more transactions at a lower fee), you might later reduce it further, just as Avalanche went from 75→25→1 nAVAX ([Apricot Phase Three: C-Chain Dynamic Fees | by Patrick O'Grady | Avalanche | Medium](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/apricot-phase-three-c-chain-dynamic-fees-432d32d67b60#:~:text=minimum%20gas%20price%20decreases,as%20has%20been)) ([Etna: Enhancing the Sovereignty of Avalanche L1 Networks | Avalanche Blog](https://www.avax.network/blog/etna-enhancing-the-sovereignty-of-avalanche-l1-networks#:~:text=This%20upgrade%20activates%20ACP,during%20periods%20of%20low%20activity)). Keep an eye on metrics like average block gas unused (if consistently > 50% unused and no spam, perhaps fees could be lower) or, conversely, on user experience (if users complain of fee spikes, maybe increase capacity sooner). The bottom line is to treat the fee mechanism as a **living system** that you will fine-tune to achieve the *specific stability goals* of your subnet. Given it’s a USDC network, you might prioritize **predictability** above all: users should reliably know that a USDC transfer will cost e.g. around $0.001 at most under normal conditions. If any part of the mechanism threatens that (like sudden volatility), adjust that part (increase supply, tweak parameters). 

**9. Testing and Worst-Case Scenarios:** Before launch (and periodically in test environments), simulate high-load scenarios to see how your chosen parameters behave. For instance, **flood the network with transactions in a testnet** to force blocks full for a few minutes, and observe the base fee trajectory. Ensure that the fee doesn’t oscillate out of control (it shouldn’t with Moderato’s smoothing) and that if it hits any cap, the system still functions (transactions queue up and then get processed once load reduces). This will give confidence that in a real-world spike (maybe a sudden integration causing a burst of USDC transfers), the subnet will remain stable – perhaps fees will rise a bit, but within the bounds you set, and then quickly recover. Also test **very low usage** scenarios (does the base fee drop to the floor as expected? any issues with precision when it’s at minimum?). Basically, validate that your **fee mechanism clears demand spikes without causing instability** (like chain halts or huge delays) and returns to baseline smoothly. Ethereum’s “chaotic” block oscillation was still stable in terms of consensus ([Transaction Fees on a Honeymoon: Ethereum&#x0027;s EIP-1559 One Month Later](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/180741021/Transaction_Fees_on_a_Honeymoon_Ethereums_EIP_1559_One_Month_Later.pdf#:~:text=evaluate%20the%20impact%20of%20EIP,alternative%20base%20fee%20adjustment%20rule)); you want at least that, and preferably even smoother. Avalanche’s empirical results post-AP5 can be a benchmark – they showed increased gas usage accompanied by *lower* average fees ([RL1: Digging into Avalanche | Galaxy](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/ready-layer-one-avalanche/#:~:text=representing%20block%20utilization%20of%2025,as%20gas%20consumption%20has%20increased)), which is the ideal scenario (more utility, less cost volatility). Aim for that dynamic: as your subnet grows, users shouldn’t proportionally pay more in fees – rather, the mechanism and your upgrades absorb the growth.

By following these recommendations, the USDC Avalanche subnet can achieve: **(a)** extremely low fees during normal operation (base fee at floor, plenty of headroom), **(b)** controlled fee increases during sudden demand peaks (preventing overload while still processing a lot of transactions), **(c)** avoidance of sustained backlogs (thanks to the fee rises and especially the ability to increase capacity), and **(d)** overall predictable fee ranges which is critical for a stablecoin platform. In essence, you will combine the best aspects of Ethereum’s proven fee market (robust self-regulation) with Avalanche’s stability-oriented tweaks (smoothing, fee bounds) and Base’s philosophy of scaling supply. The result should be a **stable fee environment** where USDC transfers and contracts execute with minimal cost variability. Users and integrators can be confident that, for example, a transaction will usually cost say 0.001 USDC, and even in a rush maybe it temporarily goes up to 0.005 USDC, but not suddenly $1 – and if the network regularly hits 0.005, you’ll adjust to bring it back down. This predictability and low fee regime will make the subnet attractive for high-volume stablecoin uses (payments, DeFi, gaming, etc.) without the fear of “fee spikes” that have plagued L1 Ethereum at times. 

Finally, document these parameters and policies clearly for your users: publish the initial base fee parameters (min, target gas, etc.) and commit to monitoring and adjusting in the interest of fee stability. This transparency will build trust that the subnet’s fee mechanism is well-managed, much like how Avalanche communicated changes in Apricot and Etna upgrades to reassure users of cheaper fees and improved performance ([Etna: Enhancing the Sovereignty of Avalanche L1 Networks | Avalanche Blog](https://www.avax.network/blog/etna-enhancing-the-sovereignty-of-avalanche-l1-networks#:~:text=This%20upgrade%20activates%20ACP,during%20periods%20of%20low%20activity)). With these measures, your USDC Avalanche subnet can achieve a **high-throughput, low-volatility fee market** tailored for a stablecoin economy.
